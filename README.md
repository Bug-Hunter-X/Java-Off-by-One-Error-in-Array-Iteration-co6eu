This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle programming error in Java: the off-by-one error.  The provided `bug.java` file contains code that attempts to iterate through an array, but due to an incorrect loop condition, it attempts to access an index outside the array's bounds, resulting in an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. The `bugSolution.java` file offers a corrected version, highlighting the importance of carefully considering array indices when iterating.
